# Kubernetes!

## Introduction

Diving deeper into the cloud environment, I've come to realize that I need to learn Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration tool that helps manage containerised app in different deployment environment, since the trend has moved from Monolith to Microservices and multiple containers needs to be managed properly.


## Cloud Research

Recently installed kubectl and minikube to get hands-on practical experience to complement my theorectical knowledge.
