# AWS Budgets

## Introduction

First things first, set budgets so as to get notified by email when my charges reaches 80% of the set budget. I don't want to go in debt playing around with services. :p

## Prerequisite
No prerequisites, just the maximum amount you'll like to spend if you go over the free tier level.


## Use Case

I created a monthly budget for $1 because why not.


## Cloud Research

- cost explorer might not be available if you created your account the same day you plan to set budgets, check back in 24hrs.
- setting budget also helps when your account is hacked because you'll get email notifications when the hacker start using services that exceeds your budgeted amount.


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

-Incase you get billed and dont why, go to bills. It shows a breakdown of AWS service charges.


## Try yourself

Go on, try it. Set a budget and lets start this journey together.


## Next Step

Create IAM users and start practicing Linux.
